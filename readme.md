# pimpcasting
Hey folks, 

figured I should at least give rough directions when open sourcing my config. So here it goes, got way too big but there's a lot to talk about, I promise it's #worth.

## Introduction and Prep

Before just casually copying this config in your Dota 2 config folder, please make sure that you save the current values for the console variables (convars) which are over ridden by my config. Example:

```
dota_camera_speed 3000
```

is way too slow to play the game with it but really perfect to obs/cast with. So what I would suggest is the following:

1. Take a look into my `pimpcasting.cfg` and take note which commands you want to change for playing the game
2. Save all of these commands in a `playing.cfg`, I'll attach my `playing.cfg` at the end of this post to give you a rough idea
3. Import my `pimpcasting.cfg` which you use for casting and adjust it to your liking
4. Adjust your `autoexec.cfg` and add binds to execute each playing or casting config it could look like this:

```
//autoexec.cfg example
con_enable 1

bind "F12" "exec playing.cfg"
bind "F11" "exec pimpcasting.cfg"

exec playing.cfg //Change this to pimpcasting.cfg if you mainly cast

echo "autoexec loaded"
```

If you want to use these binds, make sure to disable the Steam Overlay camera feature as it uses `F12` as well. 

So let's do this: Go to `Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota\cfg` and adjust the `autoexec.cfg`, put your `playing.cfg` in there and paste my `pimpcasting.cfg` as well. Now open the game and adjust the keybinds in the spectator section:

These are the settings I HEAVILY recommend. The camera movement can be done via `W` `A` `S` `D`, Creep Score is then rebound to `F`. This way your left hand never needs to move on the keyboard. Huge benefit in usability.

## Observing, using the config and the assisted camera

Firstly there is a cool feature made by Valve which is called "Assisted Camera". This is a bit like the directed camera in DotaTV (which doesn't exist when casting from a lobby btw) and follows heroes around without you having to always control it.

Now load into a random game in DotaTV, after you're done loading and after the draft is done, press `F11` (or whichever other button you bound the `pimpcasting.cfg` to). Click on a lane and move to a hero, and press `Mouse4` (dota_toggle_assisted_camera_operator). Just leave your mouse and keyboard, don't do anything, you can see how your camera follows the heroes.

To adjust the camera when assisted cam is on, use `W` `A` `S` `D`, middle mouse button doesn't work when it's on.

This feature is absolutely amazing to help you a bit, however I would heavily recommend to NOT use it in teamfights as you as caster/obs will want to have full control over it, and the assisted camera doesn't give you 100% power over what it does. Same goes for framing some laning stage/jungle ganks. 

I made these high quality flow chart as rough idea:

```
                              Is there a teamfight?
                              /                   \
                             /                     \
                            /                       \
                          No                        Yes
                          |                            \
            Is a lot happening regardless?              \
                /                       \          Turn assisted cam off
               /                         \            Use Mouse 3 drag
              /                           \
             No                           Yes 
             |                             |
   Keep assisted cam on           Turn assisted cam off
     Adjust with WASD                Use Mouse 3 drag
```

```
          Do you use WASD to move the camera without using assisted cam?
              /                                            \
             /                                              \
            /                                                \
           No                                                Yes
            |                                                 |
          Correct!                                   Don't. It looks like shit
```

Smooth drag via `Mouse 3` still yields by far the most precise Camera, but it's fine to not use it a lot and abuse assisted camera, especially when casting.

## Tips and Tricks

### Do you want to click on the minimap AND don't have assisted camera on?

Hold `SHIFT` until the movement completes, it makes the transition smooth. If there's impending action, don't.

### Are you using this config on a LAN setting?

Remove the // characters before "dota_silent_roshan 1". It shuts up roshan and smoke.

### Do you want to quickly check if you are lagging on the server?

Press `F10`, it will toggle the netgraph in the top right. Don't forget to disable it again.

### The zoom out per mousewheel-notch is not good!

Adjust these settings:

```
dota_camera_broadcaster_mousewheel_direction_multiplier 0.0075 
dota_camera_mousewheel_direction_multiplier 0.0075
```

I like these personally, but try a couple different ones.

### I can't move the camera any more via edge move!?

Don't. Do. It.

### Minimap icon sizes are weird.

Adjust these settings:

```
dota_minimap_hero_size 700
dota_minimap_rune_size 500
```

### Minimap icons get smaller and bigger and I don't like it.

Adjust these settings to disable it or make things larger/smaller.

```
dota_minimap_hero_scalar 1
dota_minimap_hero_scalar_distance 6
dota_minimap_hero_scalar_minimum 700
```
